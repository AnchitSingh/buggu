## üéØ Why This Project?

### The Problem
Data extraction from documents like PDFs, invoices, and bills is typically expensive and requires sharing sensitive data with third-party services. Many users face privacy concerns and costs associated with these services.

### The Solution
This web application solves these issues by:
- Using Chrome's built-in AI for completely on-device processing
- Ensuring zero data leakage - your documents never leave your computer
- Making data extraction affordable and accessible to everyone
- Providing customizable extraction based on natural language instructions

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: CSS with Tailwind-inspired classes
- **AI Processing**: Chrome's LanguageModel API
- **Build Tool**: Vite.js
- **Browser**: Requires Chrome 127+ with AI features enabled

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Chrome browser version 127 or higher
- Chrome AI features enabled (chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pdf-to-json
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## üìñ Usage

1. Upload your PDF or image files
2. Describe what data you want to extract in natural language
3. Review document previews if needed
4. Click "Process Files" to extract structured JSON
5. Copy, download, or integrate the extracted data into your applications

### Example Use Cases
- **Invoice Processing**: Extract invoice numbers, dates, vendor info, line items, and totals
- **Receipt Analysis**: Extract store names, dates, items, and total amounts
- **Study Material**: Convert textbook pages to structured content for note-taking apps
- **Document Archiving**: Convert paper documents to JSON for database storage

### Natural Language Schema Examples
- "Extract invoice number, date, vendor name, items with prices, subtotal, tax, and total"
- "Get all line items with product names, quantities, unit prices, and totals"
- "Extract student names, grades, and subjects from a report card"

## üîß Architecture
